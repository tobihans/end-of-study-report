Higher education is facing new constraints, such as the inability to attend face-to-face classes due to various factors such as pandemics. 
Real-time communication technologies offer a promising alternative that must be exploited to meet these challenges. 
In order to promote the use of these communication tools, our project proposes StudX, a prototype application for virtual classes. 
The development of this platform required the use of modern software modeling techniques, state-of-the-art technologies and various resources. 
StudX provides a reliable solution to the distance learning needs of universities through WebRTC-based real-time communication capabilities. 
This project is an important contribution to the exploitation of real-time communication technologies in the field of education and has the potential to be extended to meet new needs.\newline\newline
